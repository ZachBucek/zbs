        <h3>> ABOUT ME</h3>
        <h4>- I am a web designer and developer. My skills run the gamut from layout and logo design through UI/UX and front-end development. I also do WordPress development, creating custom themes for clients who want something more than what comes out of the box. <br>
            - With all of my projects, I seek to harness the complexity of information systems to create a lasting connection with the end user. This also means working closely with clients to develop a durable identity and design system.
